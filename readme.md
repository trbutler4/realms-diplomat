# Eternum Diplomat

The diplomat is developed with a mocked out graphql server to represent Eternum world state.

This project is based on [daydreams](https://github.com/daydreamsai/daydreams)

First, install packages
```bash
bun install
```

To start the mocked server:
```bash
bun start:graphql
```

To start diplomacy
```bash
bun start:diplomat
```

To start daydreams without diplomat logic:
```bash
bun start
```
